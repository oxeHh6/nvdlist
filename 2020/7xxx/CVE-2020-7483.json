This vulnerability was discovered in and remediated in versions v4.9.1 and v4.10.1 on May 30, 2013. The 'password' feature is an additional optional check performed by TS1131 that it is connected to a specific controller. This data is sent as clear text and is visible on the network. This feature is not present in TriStation 1131 versions v4.9.1 and v4.10.1 through current. Therefore, the vulnerability is not present in these versions."

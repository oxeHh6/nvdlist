Product affected - All versions affected prior to Silver Peak Unity ECOS\u2122 8.3.2+, 8.1.9.12+ and Silver Peak Unity Orchestrator\u2122 8.9.2+ 1. Silver Peak product(s) Applicability 2. Unity EdgeConnect, NX, VX Applicable 3. Unity Orchestrator Applicable 4. EdgeConnect in AWS, Azure, GCP Applicable 5. Silver Peak Cloud Services Not Applicable Resolution \u2022 Changes have been made to strengthen the initial exchange between the EdgeConnect appliance and the Orchestrator. After the changes, EdgeConnect will validate the certificate used to identify the Orchestrator to EdgeConnect. \u2022 TLS itself is continually subject to newly discovered and exploitable vulnerabilities. As such, all versions of EdgeConnect software implement additional out-of-band and user-controlled authentication mechanisms. Any required configuration \u2022 Do not change Orchestrator\u2019s IP address as discovered by the EdgeConnect appliance. \u2022 Upgrade to Silver Peak Unity ECOS\u2122 8.3.2+ or 8.1.9.12+ and Silver Peak Unity Orchestrator\u2122 8.9.2+. \u2022 In Orchestrator, enable the \u201cVerify Orchestrator Certificate\u201d option under Advanced Security Settings."

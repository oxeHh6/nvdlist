The vm::arrayCopy method defined in classpath-common.h contains multiple boundary checks that are performed to prevent out-of-bounds memory read/write. However, two of these boundary checks contain an integer overflow that leads to a bypass of these checks, and out-of-bounds read/write. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer."

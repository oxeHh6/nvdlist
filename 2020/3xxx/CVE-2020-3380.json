The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions during the execution of an affected CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as the fmserver user and submitting malicious input to a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system."

The vulnerability is due to the improper processing of client packets that are sent to an affected access point (AP). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of sustained client packets to the affected AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected AP to crash, resulting in a DoS condition."

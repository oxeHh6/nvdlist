The vulnerability is due to improper handling of input to the application protocol handlers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a link within a message sent by email or other messaging platform. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system with the privileges of the user account that is running the Cisco Jabber client software."

This may happen naturally if you start a network, have it run for some time and restart it (**without changing chainID**). A malicious block proposer (even with a minimal amount of stake) can use this vulnerability to completely halt the network.\n\nThis issue is fixed in Tendermint 0.33.6 which checks all the signatures are for the block with 2/3+ majority before creating a commit."
